This project as stated before presumes that the user already 
has xampp installed in his/her system.

Steps to be Followed after downloading zip file:-

1) Create a folder named 'exam' inside xampp\htdocs

2) Extract the contents of the zip file to the above created folder

3) Go to this location:-

	exam\application\config

	
	(a) Open the file config.php

		set==>    $config['base_url'] to the base of your project.

		e.g. If you are using port # 567 in apache, then we would set as:-

			$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost:567/exam/';

		Save the file before closing.

	(b) Open the file database.php (It's in the same folder)

		set==>  $db['default']['username'] to your mysql username,
				$db['default']['password'] to your mysql password

	<=========This project assumes the port used by mysql is the default one: 3306==============>
	<=========If not change the hostname too accordingly========================================>


4) Now open phpmyadmin in your browser.

	Go to 'Import' option. Then select the file called 'exam.sql' lying in the root location (directly inside exam).

	Click 'Go' button.

5) You are good to go.
